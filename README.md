## Turning on/off the robot

### Turning on the platform: base buttons and led indicators

To turn on the platform the red and black buttons must be pressed simultaneously for about three seconds, until the red led turns on. That indicates that the platform is connected, but not its motors necessarily. To turn on the motors the blue botton must be pressed until the blue leds is turned on (about a third of a second). Pressing the red button is enough to turn off the platform.

The leds on the right indicate the status of the robot in terms of charge.
