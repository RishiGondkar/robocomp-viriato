CMake Warning (dev) in src/CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0071 is not set: Let AUTOMOC and AUTOUIC process GENERATED files.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0071" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility, CMake is excluding the GENERATED source file(s):

    "/home/robolab/robocomp/components/robocomp-viriato/components/humanPose/cmake-build-debug/src/CommonBehavior.cpp"
    "/home/robolab/robocomp/components/robocomp-viriato/components/humanPose/cmake-build-debug/src/HumanTracker.cpp"
    "/home/robolab/robocomp/components/robocomp-viriato/components/humanPose/cmake-build-debug/src/FaceTracking.cpp"
    "/home/robolab/robocomp/components/robocomp-viriato/components/humanPose/cmake-build-debug/src/AGMExecutive.cpp"
    "/home/robolab/robocomp/components/robocomp-viriato/components/humanPose/cmake-build-debug/src/AGMWorldModel.cpp"
    "/home/robolab/robocomp/components/robocomp-viriato/components/humanPose/cmake-build-debug/src/Planning.cpp"
    "/home/robolab/robocomp/components/robocomp-viriato/components/humanPose/cmake-build-debug/src/AGMCommonBehavior.cpp"

  from processing by AUTOMOC and AUTOUIC.  If any of the files should be
  processed, set CMP0071 to NEW.  If any of the files should not be
  processed, explicitly exclude them by setting the source file property
  SKIP_AUTOGEN:

    set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOGEN ON)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
